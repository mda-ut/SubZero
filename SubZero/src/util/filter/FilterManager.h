/**
 * The main job of a FilterManager, identified by its FMID, is to use
 * a ordered set of user defined filters to filter data. Reference
 * data is passed to the FM and a filtered deep copy of that data is
 * then referenced back out to the user. FM tags each filtered data
 * with its FMID to signify its responsibility for the data point. FM
 * also manages the ordered set of filters and provide basic functions:
 * insert, replace and delete for the user to easily alter the set of
 * filters hereby referred to as the filterChain. To manage the
 * filterChain, users are given to opportunity to give each filter a
 * customized ID and be able to access the filters in a personalized
 * manner. Should the user feel not want the need of custom IDing, the
 * automatic IDing mode will complete the process with stock IDs that
 * the user can then use to refer to the filters.
